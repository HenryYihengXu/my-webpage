      With the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, AI is
      becoming more and more popular, as it is greatly changing people's life.
      It has already been applied to many different fields to assist people to
      live better: from speech recognition to automatic transportation, AI is
      prevalent in our life. It is also marching towards many other new areas,
      and education is one of them. Today education is one of the most important
      parts of our society, so it’s natural for us to apply a new technology to
      enhance education. Marr (2018) mentioned that as estimated, educational AI
      in the US is going to increase by 47.5% in 2021 compared with 2017 (para.
      1). If AI is widely used in education, it will be effective in improving
      education quality. AI’s ability to store huge amounts of information and
      simulate teaching process may give it the potential to be useful in
      teaching students directly. Therefore, some people might argue it can play
      the role of independent teachers to teach learner knowledge without a
      human teacher. However, this may not be AI’s main advantage in helping
      education quality. AI may not be able to replace teachers. Even though
      there are some intelligent tutoring systems or robots can work as teachers
      to teach learners by themselves, they have some limitations and those
      systems or robots may not be the main application of AI in teaching
      process. The significance for its involvement with teaching is more about
      AI’s ability to gather and analyze data to assist students and human
      teachers. Most likely, AI will work as an assistant instead of an
      independent teacher, because it can find problems in student’s learning
      process, provide customized learning materials and service, and help
      teachers improve their teaching process. It is noticeable that Artificial
      Intelligence technology is booming today and will be beneficial to the
      education area. To briefly introduce AI, AI is the manmade computer system
      that can do many complex tasks, which involve “intelligence” as humans
      involve. According to Nilsson (2010), AI technology is the commitment to
      endowing machines with intelligence, and to making them able to properly
      achieve functions. (p. 13). Scientists are trying their best to enable
      machines to behave more humanlike. In the machine learning field,
      scientists focus on algorithms that seem to have learning ability (Kohavi
      & Provost, 1998, p. 3). Howe (2007) said that AI is related to solving
      complicated problems in high level (para. 2). By these definitions, it is
      safe to conclude that AI is a highly effective tool in solving tasks that
      were once considered resolvable only by humans.

      Education involves such kinds of tasks so that it is a promising field of
      AI. Stanford scientists Stone et al. (2016) proposed that AI in education
      has made significant progress (p. 31). The applications are extensively
      adopted in K-12 schools and universities (p. 31). For instance, reporters
      from PHYSORG (2018) reported that a kind of teaching robot is now used in
      some Chinese kindergarten to interact with kids (para. 1). Therefore, it
      is almost a fact that AI will have a positive influence on education, and
      this influence will be on all education levels. But AI can play different
      roles in education, so it’s good to research on what mostly contributes to
      AI’s effectiveness in education. Because there are some intelligent
      tutoring systems that work as teachers, AI’s ability of directly teaching
      students may seem to be a good analysis for why it is effective in
      education. The huge storage of AI and machine learning skills makes AI
      able to become an expert in some fields and simulate the teaching process.
      Lee and Hyun (2015) introduced an intelligent robot called iRobiQ that can
      help speech-language disordered children with communication skills
      (“Abstract” section, para. 1). They reported that the robot improves
      disordered children’s communication skills by emotionally interact with
      them. For instance, the robot can talk to children with all kinds of
      “entertaining scripts” which encourage children to communicate and express
      emotions (“Talking friend iRobiQ” section, para. 1-2). Lee and Hyun also
      concluded that the robot might be more effective than human in interacting
      with disordered children due to its relatively simple language cues
      (“Conclusion” section, para. 1). This evidence demonstrates that AI is
      capable of teaching learners by itself. Moreover, by using more advanced
      technologies, scientists can make a tutoring system simulate the whole
      learning environment. Johnson and Valente (2008) reported an intelligent
      tutoring system that helps people to learn foreign languages and culture.
      They noted that the program could simulate the dialogue situation with
      virtual humans, so that learner will more likely feel they are in the real
      language learning environment (“Believable Virtual Humans” section, para.
      1). They pointed out that learners significantly gained knowledge of
      Arabic language and culture, and 75% of learners obtained a proficiency
      level after trained for 40 hours (Application Use and Payoff” section,
      para. 4). Thus, this tutoring program is able to not only teach knowledge,
      but also provide a virtual learning environment. It’s a teaching program
      in the form of a video game, so that human teachers are not necessary for
      this teaching process. With this feature, it seems to be quite close to
      real human teachers.
